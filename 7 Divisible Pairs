You are given an array A[N] of size N.
We define a 7-Divisible Pair as a pair of integers (i,j) such that Ai + Aj is divisible by 7.
Formally, a pair of integers (i,j) is a 7-Divisible pair if ( Ai + Aj ) % 7 = 0.
Your task is to find the total number of 7-Divisible pairs from the given array.

INPUT

First line contains N the size of the array. (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).
Second line contains the array elements that all lie between 1 and 105.

OUTPUT

Output a single integer that denotes the number of pairs divisible by 7.
